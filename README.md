# Portfolio Project

> My first portfolio website — where it all began.

A personal portfolio built from scratch using pure HTML & CSS. This project marks the beginning of my web development journey and holds a special place as my first attempt at creating something for the web.

## 💭 About This Project

This is my very first portfolio website, handcrafted with HTML and CSS when I was just starting to learn web development. Every line of code, every styling decision, and every image placement represents the excitement and challenges of building something from nothing.

It's not perfect, but it's precious — a snapshot of where I started.

## 💙 Why It Matters

This project isn't just code — it's a memory. It represents the moment when curiosity turned into creation, when I went from reading tutorials to building something real. Every beginner project is special because it proves you can start from zero and make something tangible.

## 🌱 Growth

Since creating this portfolio, I've moved on to modern frameworks and more complex projects. But this remains a reminder of where I started and how far I've come.
